## Features
- **Java 17**, **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, **Maven**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (Selenium Grid)
- **Jenkins pipelines** (Jenkinsfile for CI/CD integration)
- **Config-driven execution** (environment-based `.properties` files + enums)

- **Logging with Logback**
- **Allure reports** with screenshots on failure
- **Parallel execution** with TestNG
- **Grid HealthCheck utility** (custom Java class to validate Grid readiness)

## About
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable automation framework from scratch, 
integrated with containerized infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.  
It can serve as a learning resource or a base for more advanced test frameworks.
